He was waiting for a call from the President of a far distant country, and between wondering when the wretched man would telephone, and trying to suppress unpleasant memories of what had been a very long, tiring, and difficult week, there was not much space in his head for anything else. The more he attempted to focus on the print on the page before him, the more clearly the Prime Minister could see the gloating face of one of his political opponents. This particular opponent had appeared on the news that very day, not only to enumerate all the terrible things that had happened in the last week (as though anyone needed reminding) but also to explain why each and every one of them was the government's fault. The Prime Minister's pulse quickened at the very thought of these accusations, for they were neither fair nor true. How on earth was his government supposed to have stopped that bridge collapsing? It was outrageous for anybody to suggest that they were not spending enough on bridges. The bridge was fewer than ten years old, and the best experts were at a loss to explain why it had snapped cleanly in two, sending a dozen cars into the watery depths of the river below. And how dare anyone suggest that it was lack of policemen that had resulted in those two very nasty and well-publicized murders? Or that the government should have somehow foreseen the freak hurricane in the West Country that had caused so much damage to both people and property?"}

He watched, trying not to betray a flicker of surprise or alarm, as a portly man appeared within the flames, spinning as fast as a top. Seconds later, he had climbed out onto a rather fine antique rug, brushing ash from the sleeves of his long pin-striped cloak, a lime-green bowler hat in his hand. \"Ah ... Prime Minister,\" said Cornelius Fudge, striding forward with his hand outstretched. \"Good to see you again.\" The Prime Minister could not honestly return this compliment, so said nothing at all. He was not remotely pleased to see Fudge, whose occasional appearances, apart from being downright alarming in themselves, generally meant that he was about to hear some very bad news. Furthermore, Fudge was looking distinctly careworn. He was thinner, balder, and grayer, and his face had a crumpled look. The Prime Minister had seen that kind of look in politicians before, and it never boded well. \"How can I help you?\" he said, shaking Fudge's hand very briefly and gesturing toward the hardest of the chairs in front of the desk. \"Difficult to know where to begin,\" muttered Fudge, pulling up the chair, sitting down, and placing his green bowler upon his knees. \"What a week, what a week ...\"\n\"Had a bad one too, have you?\""}

The Brockdale Bridge ... the Bones and Vance murders ... not to mention the ruckus in the West Country ...\"\n\"You - er - your - I mean to say, some of your people were - were involved in those - those things, were they?\" Fudge fixed the Prime Minister with a rather stern look. \"Of course they were,\" he said. \"Surely you've realized what's going on?\" \"I ...\" hesitated the Prime Minister.

But of course, it had been like this from his very first meeting with Fudge on his very first evening as Prime Minister. He remembered it as though it were yesterday and knew it would haunt him until his dying day. He had been standing alone in this very office, savoring the triumph that was his after so many years of dreaming and scheming, when he had heard a cough behind him, just like tonight, and turned to find that ugly little portrait talking to him, announcing that the Minister of Magic was about to arrive and introduce himself. Naturally, he had thought that the long campaign and the strain of the election had caused him to go mad. He had been utterly terrified to find a portrait talking to him, though this had been nothing to how he felt when a self-proclaimed wizard had bounced out of the fireplace and shaken his hand. He had remained speechless throughout Fudge's kindly explanation that there were witches and wizards still living in secret all over the world and his reassurances that he was not to bother his head about them as the Ministry of Magic took responsibility for the whole Wizarding community and prevented the non-magical population from getting wind of them. It was, said Fudge, a difficult job that encompassed everything from regulations on responsible use of broomsticks to keeping the dragon population under control (the Prime Minister remembered clutching the desk for support at this point). Fudge had then patted the shoulder of the still-dumbstruck Prime Minister in a fatherly sort of way. \"Not to worry,\" he had said, \"it's odds-on you'll never see me again. I'll only bother you if there's something really serious going on our end, something that's likely to affect the Muggles - the non-magical population, I should say. Otherwise, it's live and let live."}

Look.\" And he had turned the Prime Minister's teacup into a gerbil. \"But,\" said the Prime Minister breathlessly, watching his teacup chewing on the corner of his next speech, \"but why - why has nobody told me - ?\" \"The Minister of Magic only reveals him- or herself to the Muggle Prime Minister of the day,\" said Fudge, poking his wand back inside his jacket."}

The Prime Minister had stood there, quite motionless, and realized that he would never, as long as he lived, dare mention this encounter to a living soul, for who in the wide world would believe him? The shock had taken a little while to wear off. For a time, he had tried to convince himself that Fudge had indeed been a hallucination brought on by lack of sleep during his grueling election campaign. In a vain attempt to rid himself of all reminders of this uncomfortable encounter, he had given the gerbil to his delighted niece and instructed his private secretary to take down the portrait of the ugly little man who had announced Fudge's arrival. To the Prime Minister's dismay, however, the portrait had proved impossible to remove."}

Occasionally he could have sworn he saw out of the corner of his eye the occupant of the painting yawning, or else scratching his nose; even, once or twice, simply walking out of his frame and leaving nothing but a stretch of muddy-brown canvas behind. However, he had trained himself not to look at the picture very much, and always to tell himself firmly that his eyes were playing tricks on him when anything like this happened. Then, three years ago, on a night very like tonight, the Prime Minister had been alone in his office when the portrait had once again announced the imminent arrival of Fudge, who had burst out of the fireplace, sopping wet and in a state of considerable panic. Before the Prime Minister could ask why he was dripping all over the Axminster, Fudge had started ranting about a prison the Prime Minister had never heard of, a man named \"Serious\" Black, something that sounded like \"Hogwarts,\" and a boy called Harry Potter, none of which made the remotest sense to the Prime Minister. \"... I've just come from Azkaban,\" Fudge had panted, tipping a large amount of water out of the rim of his bowler hat into his pocket. \"Middle of the North Sea, you know, nasty flight ... the dementors are in uproar\" - he shuddered - \"they've never had a breakout before. Anyway, I had to come to you, Prime Minister. Black's a known Muggle killer and may be planning to rejoin You-Know-Who. ... But of course, you don't even know who You-Know-Who is!\""}

Have a whiskey ...\"\nThe Prime Minister rather resented being told to sit down in his own office, let alone offered his own whiskey, but he sat nevertheless. Fudge pulled out his wand, conjured two large glasses full of amber liquid out of thin air, pushed one of them into the Prime Minister's hand, and drew up a chair. Fudge had talked for more than an hour. At one point, he had refused to say a certain name aloud and wrote it instead on a piece of parchment, which he had thrust into the Prime Minister's whiskey-free hand. When at last Fudge had stood up to leave, the Prime Minister had stood up too. \"So you think that ...\" He had squinted down at the name in his left hand. \"Lord Vol -\"\n\"He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named!\" snarled Fudge. \"I'm sorry. ... You think that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is still alive, then?\" \"Well, Dumbledore says he is,\" said Fudge, as he had fastened his pin-striped cloak under his chin, \"but we've never found him.

Well, I hope we don't see each other again, Prime Minister! Good night.\" But they had seen each other again. Less than a year later a harassed-looking Fudge had appeared out of thin air in the cabinet room to inform the Prime Minister that there had been a spot of bother at the Kwidditch (or that was what it had sounded like) World Cup and that several Muggles had been \"involved,\" but that the Prime Minister was not to worry, the fact that You-Know-Who's Mark had been seen again meant nothing; Fudge was sure it was an isolated incident, and the Muggle Liaison Office was dealing with all memory modifications as they spoke. \"Oh, and I almost forgot,\" Fudge had added."}

Well, good day to you.\" The Prime Minister had hoped beyond hope that dragons and sphinxes would be the worst of it, but no. Less than two years later, Fudge had erupted out of the fire yet again, this time with the news that there had been a mass breakout from Azkaban. \"A mass breakout?\" repeated the Prime Minister hoarsely."}

Whatever the press and the opposition might say, the Prime Minister was not a foolish man. It had not escaped his notice that, despite Fudge's assurances at their first meeting, they were now seeing rather a lot of each other, nor that Fudge was becoming more flustered with each visit. Little though he liked to think about the Minister of Magic (or, as he always called Fudge in his head, the Other Minister), the Prime Minister could not help but fear that the next time Fudge appeared it would be with graver news still. The sight, therefore, of Fudge stepping out of the fire once more, looking disheveled and fretful and sternly surprised that the Prime Minister did not know exactly why he was there, was about the worst thing that had happened in the course of this extremely gloomy week. \"How should I know what's going on in the - er - Wizarding community?\" snapped the Prime Minister now. \"I have a country to run and quite enough concerns at the moment without -\"\n\"We have the same concerns,\" Fudge interrupted. \"The Brockdale Bridge didn't wear out.

I don't really understand it, and Dumbledore won't explain properly - but anyway, he's certainly got a body and is walking and talking and killing, so I suppose, for the purposes of our discussion, yes, he's alive.\" The Prime Minister did not know what to say to this, but a persistent habit of wishing to appear well-informed on any subject that came up made him cast around for any details he could remember of their previous conversations."}

Not yet, anyway ... While the Prime Minister surreptitiously touched the wood of his desk, Fudge continued, \"But Black's by-the-by now.

It's your responsibility as Minister of Magic!\" \"My dear Prime Minister, you can't honestly think I'm still Minister of Magic after all this? I was sacked three days ago!

Fudge got to his feet and, after a moment's hesitation, the Prime Minister did the same, watching the new arrival straighten up, dust down his long black robes, and look around. The Prime Minister's first, foolish thought was that Rufus Scrimgeour looked rather like an old lion. There were streaks of gray in his mane of tawny hair and his bushy eyebrows; he had keen yellowish eyes behind a pair of wire-rimmed spectacles and a certain rangy, loping grace even though he walked with a slight limp. There was an immediate impression of shrewdness and toughness; the Prime Minister thought he understood why the Wizarding community preferred Scrimgeour to Fudge as a leader in these dangerous times. \"How do you do?\" said the Prime Minister politely, holding out his hand.

There was no sound apart from the whisper of the black water and no sign of life apart from a scrawny fox that had slunk down the bank to nose hopefully at some old fish-and-chip wrappings in the tall grass. But then, with a very faint pop, a slim, hooded figure appeared out of thin air on the edge of the river. The fox froze, wary eyes fixed upon this strange new phenomenon. The figure seemed to take its bearings for a few moments, then set off with light, quick strides, its long cloak rustling over the grass. With a second and louder pop, another hooded figure materialized. \"Wait!\" The harsh cry startled the fox, now crouching almost flat in the undergrowth. It leapt from its hiding place and up the bank. There was a flash of green light, a yelp, and the fox fell back to the ground, dead. The second figure turned over the animal with its toe. \"Just a fox,\" said a woman's voice dismissively from under the hood. \"I thought perhaps an Auror - Cissy, wait!\" But her quarry, who had paused and looked back at the flash of light, was already scrambling up the bank the fox had just fallen down."}

She had knocked on the door before Bella, cursing under her breath, had caught up. Together they stood waiting, panting slightly, breathing in the smell of the dirty river that was carried to them on the night breeze.

A sliver of a man could be seen looking out at them, a man with long black hair parted in curtains around a sallow face and black eyes. Narcissa threw back her hood. She was so pale that she seemed to shine in the darkness; the long blonde hair streaming down her back gave her the look of a drowned person. \"Narcissa!\" said the man, opening the door a little wider, so that the light fell upon her and her sister too. \"What a pleasant surprise! \"Severus,\" she said in a strained whisper."}

He dropped these on the rickety table and scurried from their presence, slamming the book-covered door behind him. Snape poured out three glasses of bloodred wine and handed two of them to the sisters. Narcissa murmured a word of thanks, whilst Bellatrix said nothing, but continued to glower at Snape.

It just seemed too good to be true that he was going to be rescued from the Dursleys after a mere fortnight of their company. He could not shrug off the feeling that something was going to go wrong - his reply to Dumbledore's letter might have gone astray; Dumbledore could be prevented from collecting him; the letter might turn out not to be from Dumbledore at all, but a trick or joke or trap. Harry had not been able to face packing and then being let down and having to unpack again. The only gesture he had made to the possibility of a journey was to shut his snowy owl, Hedwig, safely in her cage. The minute hand on the alarm clock reached the number twelve and, at that precise moment, the streetlamp outside the window went out. Harry awoke as though the sudden darkness were an alarm. Hastily straightening his glasses and unsticking his cheek from the glass, he pressed his nose against the window instead and squinted down at the pavement. A tall figure in a long, billowing cloak was walking up the garden path. Harry jumped up as though he had received an electric shock, knocked over his chair, and started snatching anything and everything within reach from the floor and throwing it into the trunk. Even as he lobbed a set of robes, two spellbooks, and a packet of crisps across the room, the doorbell rang. Downstairs in the living room his Uncle Vernon shouted, \"Who the blazes is calling at this time of night?\" Harry froze with a brass telescope in one hand and a pair of trainers in the other.

I daresay Harry has told you I would be coming for him?\" Harry ran down the stairs two at a time, coming to an abrupt halt several steps from the bottom, as long experience had taught him to remain out of arm's reach of his uncle whenever possible. There in the doorway stood a tall, thin man with waist-length silver hair and beard. Half-moon spectacles were perched on his crooked nose, and he was wearing a long black traveling cloak and a pointed hat. Vernon Dursley, whose mustache was quite as bushy as Dumbledore's, though black, and who was wearing a puce dressing gown, was staring at the visitor as though he could not believe his tiny eyes. \"Judging by your look of stunned disbelief, Harry did not warn you that I was coming,\" said Dumbledore pleasantly."}

Harry did not doubt that speech would return to him, and soon - the vein pulsing in his uncle's temple was reaching danger point - but something about Dumbledore seemed to have robbed him temporarily of breath. It might have been the blatant wizardishness of his appearance, but it might, too, have been that even Uncle Vernon could sense that here was a man whom it would be very difficult to bully. \"Ah, good evening Harry,\" said Dumbledore, looking up at him through his half-moon glasses with a most satisfied expression."}
{"title_num": 6, "title": "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince", "chapter_num": 3, "chapter_name": "Will and Won't", "passage": "\"Excellent, excellent.\" These words seemed to rouse Uncle Vernon. It was clear that as far as he was concerned, any man who could look at Harry and say \"excellent\" was a man with whom he could never see eye to eye. \"I don't mean to be rude -\" he began, in a tone that threatened rudeness in every syllable. \"- yet, sadly, accidental rudeness occurs alarmingly often,\" Dumbledore finished the sentence gravely. \"Best to say nothing at all, my dear man. Ah, and this must be Petunia.\" The kitchen door had opened, and there stood Harry's aunt, wearing rubber gloves and a housecoat over her nightdress, clearly halfway through her usual pre-bedtime wipe-down of all the kitchen surfaces. Her rather horsey face registered nothing but shock. \"Albus Dumbledore,\" said Dumbledore, when Uncle Vernon failed to effect an introduction. \"We have corresponded, of course.\" Harry thought this an odd way of reminding Aunt Petunia that he had once sent her an exploding letter, but Aunt Petunia did not challenge the term."}

His large, blond head rising out of the stripy collar of his pajamas looked oddly disembodied, his mouth gaping in astonishment and fear.

He looked quite extraordinarily out of place. \"Aren't - aren't we leaving, sir?\" Harry asked anxiously. \"Yes, indeed we are, but there are a few matters we need to discuss first,\" said Dumbledore. \"And I would prefer not to do so in the open. We shall trespass upon your aunt and uncle's hospitality only a little longer.\" \"You will, will you?\" Vernon Dursley had entered the room, Petunia at his shoulder, and Dudley skulking behind them both."}

Another flick of the wand and the sofa zoomed back to its original position. \"We may as well be comfortable,\" said Dumbledore pleasantly. As he replaced his wand in his pocket, Harry saw that his hand was blackened and shriveled; it looked as though his flesh had been burned away. \"Sir - what happened to your - ?\" \"Later, Harry,\" said Dumbledore."}

The bottle tipped and poured a generous measure of honey-colored liquid into each of the glasses, which then floated to each person in the room. \"Madam Rosmerta's finest oak-matured mead,\" said Dumbledore, raising his glass to Harry, who caught hold of his own and sipped. He had never tasted anything like it before, but enjoyed it immensely. The Dursleys, after quick, scared looks at one another, tried to ignore their glasses completely, a difficult feat, as they were nudging them gently on the sides of their heads. Harry could not suppress a suspicion that Dumbledore was rather enjoying himself. \"Well, Harry,\" said Dumbledore, turning toward him, \"a difficulty has arisen which I hope you will be able to solve for us."}

Right.\" \"This is, in the main, fairly straightforward,\" Dumbledore went on. \"You add a reasonable amount of gold to your account at Gringotts, and you inherit all of Sirius's personal possessions. The slightly problematic part of the legacy -\"\n\"His godfather's dead?\" said Uncle Vernon loudly from the sofa. Dumbledore and Harry both turned to look at him.

You can have it, I don't really want it.\" Harry never wanted to set foot in number twelve, Grimmauld Place again if he could help it. He thought he would be haunted forever by the memory of Sirius prowling its dark musty rooms alone, imprisoned within the place he had wanted so desperately to leave. \"That is generous,\" said Dumbledore."}

Sirius was the very last of the line as his younger brother, Regulus, predeceased him and both were childless.

If not, then we shall have to think of some other means of keeping him from his rightful mistress.\" \"Won't, won't, won't, WON'T!\" Kreacher's voice had risen to a scream.

Hagrid has been looking after him since Sirius died, but Buckbeak is yours now, so if you would prefer to make different arrangements -\"\n\"No,\" said Harry at once, \"he can stay with Hagrid.

It took him a little over ten minutes to track down everything he needed; at last he had managed to extract his Invisibility Cloak from under the bed, screwed the top back on his jar of color-change ink, and forced the lid of his trunk shut on his cauldron. Then, heaving his trunk in one hand and holding Hedwig's cage in the other, he made his way back downstairs. He was disappointed to discover that Dumbledore was not waiting in the hall, which meant that he had to return to the living room. Nobody was talking. Dumbledore was humming quietly, apparently quite at his ease, but the atmosphere was thicker than cold custard, and Harry did not dare look at the Dursleys as he said, \"Professor - I'm ready now.\" \"Good,\" said Dumbledore. \"Just one last thing, then.\" And he turned to speak to the Dursleys once more. \"As you will no doubt be aware, Harry comes of age in a year's time -\"\n\"No,\" said Aunt Petunia, speaking for the first time since Dumbledore's arrival. \"I'm sorry?\" said Dumbledore politely."}

The Wizarding community is currently in a state of open warfare. Harry, whom Lord Voldemort has already attempted to kill on a number of occasions, is in even greater danger now than the day when I left him upon your doorstep fifteen years ago, with a letter explaining about his parents' murder and expressing the hope that you would care for him as though he were your own.\" Dumbledore paused, and although his voice remained light and calm, and he gave no obvious sign of anger, Harry felt a kind of chill emanating from him and noticed that the Dursleys drew very slightly closer together. \"You did not do as I asked. You have never treated Harry as a son. He has known nothing but neglect and often cruelty at your hands. The best that can be said is that he has at least escaped the appalling damage you have inflicted upon the unfortunate boy sitting between you.\""}

Dudley was frowning slightly, as though he was still trying to work out when he had ever been mistreated. Uncle Vernon looked as though he had something stuck in his throat; Aunt Petunia, however, was oddly flushed. \"Well, Harry ... time for us to be off,\" said Dumbledore at last, standing up and straightening his long black cloak."}

However, I would like you to bring your Invisibility Cloak ... just in case.\" Harry extracted his cloak from his trunk with some difficulty, trying not to show Dumbledore the mess within. When he had stuffed it into an inside pocket of his jacket, Dumbledore waved his wand and the trunk, cage, and Hedwig vanished.

The memory of their last face-to-face encounter kept intruding too, and it rather heightened Harry's sense of embarrassment; he had shouted a lot on that occasion, not to mention done his best to smash several of Dumbledore's most prized possessions. Dumbledore, however, seemed completely relaxed. \"Keep your wand at the ready, Harry,\" he said brightly. \"But I thought I'm not allowed to use magic outside school, sir?\" \"If there is an attack,\" said Dumbledore, \"I give you permission to use any counterjinx or curse that might occur to you."}

He felt as though he had just been forced through a very tight rubber tube. It was a few seconds before he realized that Privet Drive had vanished. He and Dumbledore were now standing in what appeared to be a deserted village square, in the center of which stood an old war memorial and a few benches.

According to a clock on a nearby church, it was almost midnight. \"So tell me, Harry,\" said Dumbledore. \"Your scar ... has it been hurting at all?\" Harry raised a hand unconsciously to his forehead and rubbed the lightning-shaped mark. \"No,\" he said, \"and I've been wondering about that."}

It appears that he is now employing Occlumency against you.\" \"Well, I'm not complaining,\" said Harry, who missed neither the disturbing dreams nor the startling flashes of insight into Voldemort's mind. They turned a corner, passing a telephone box and a bus shelter. Harry looked sideways at Dumbledore again. \"Professor?\" \"Harry?\" \"Er - where exactly are we?\" \"This, Harry, is the charming village of Budleigh Babberton.\" \"And what are we doing here?\" \"Ah yes, of course, I haven't told you,\" said Dumbledore. \"Well, I have lost count of the number of times I have said this in recent years, but we are, once again, one member of staff short. We are here to persuade an old colleague of mine to come out of retirement and return to Hogwarts.\" \"How can I help with that, sir?\" \"Oh, I think we'll find a use for you,\" said Dumbledore vaguely. \"Left here, Harry.\" They proceeded up a steep, narrow street lined with houses.

In any case, most Wizarding dwellings are magically protected from unwanted Apparators. At Hogwarts, for instance -\"\n\"- you can't Apparate anywhere inside the buildings or grounds,\" said Harry quickly. \"Hermione Granger told me.\" \"And she is quite right. We turn left again.\" The church clock chimed midnight behind them.

I saw about Madam Bones.\" \"Yes,\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"A terrible loss. She was a great witch.

To the left, another door stood open. Holding his illuminated wand aloft, Dumbledore walked into the sitting room with Harry right behind him. A scene of total devastation met their eyes.

Certainly when Slughorn, who had been busy with decanters and glasses, turned to face the room again, his eyes fell immediately upon Harry. \"Hmpf,\" he said, looking away quickly as though frightened of hurting his eyes. \"Here -\" He gave a drink to Dumbledore, who had sat down without invitation, thrust the tray at Harry, and then sank into the cushions of the repaired sofa and a disgruntled silence.

It was stuffy and cluttered, yet nobody could say it was uncomfortable; there were soft chairs and footstools, drinks and books, boxes of chocolates and plump cushions. If Harry had not known who lived there, he would have guessed at a rich, fussy old lady. \"You're not yet as old as I am, Horace,\" said Dumbledore. \"Well, maybe you ought to think about retirement yourself,\" said Slughorn bluntly.

But on the other hand ...\"\nHe shrugged and spread his hands wide, as though to say that age had its compensations, and Harry noticed a ring on his uninjured hand that he had never seen Dumbledore wear before: It was large, rather clumsily made of what looked like gold, and was set with a heavy black stone that had cracked down the middle. Slughorn's eyes lingered for a moment on the ring too, and Harry saw a tiny frown momentarily crease his wide forehead. \"So, all these precautions against intruders, Horace ... are they for the Death Eaters' benefit, or mine?\" asked Dumbledore. \"What would the Death Eaters want with a poor broken-down old buffer like me?\""}

Shielding them with one hand, he groped hopelessly for his glasses with the other. \"Wuzzgoinon?\" \"We didn't know you were here already!\" said a loud and excited voice, and he received a sharp blow to the top of the head. \"Ron, don't hit him!\" said a girl's voice reproachfully."}

Harry's included a surprise: He had been made Quidditch Captain. \"That gives you equal status with prefects!\" cried Hermione happily. \"You can use our special bathroom now and everything!\" \"Wow, I remember when Charlie wore one of these,\" said Ron, examining the badge with glee. \"Harry, this is so cool, you're my Captain - if you let me back on the team, I suppose, ha ha. ...\"\n\"Well, I don't suppose we can put off a trip to Diagon Alley much longer now you've got these,\" sighed Mrs. Weasley, looking down Ron's booklist. \"We'll go on Saturday as long as your father doesn't have to go into work again.

One of the special Ministry of Magic cars, in which Harry had ridden once before, was awaiting them in the front yard when they emerged from the house, pulling on their cloaks. \"It's good Dad can get us these again,\" said Ron appreciatively, stretching luxuriously as the car moved smoothly away from the Burrow, Bill and Fleur waving from the kitchen window. He, Harry, Hermione, and Ginny were all sitting in roomy comfort in the wide backseat. \"Don't get used to it, it's only because of Harry,\" said Mr. Weasley over his shoulder. He and Mrs. Weasley were in front with the Ministry driver; the front passenger seat had obligingly stretched into what resembled a two-seater sofa. \"He's been given top-grade security status. And we'll be joining up with additional security at the Leaky Cauldron too.\" Harry said nothing; he did not much fancy doing his shopping while surrounded by a battalion of Aurors. He had stowed his Invisibility Cloak in his backpack and felt that, if that was good enough for Dumbledore, it ought to be good enough for the Ministry, though now he came to think of it, he was not sure the Ministry knew about his cloak."}

There were no Aurors waiting outside the inn, but instead the gigantic, black-bearded form of Rubeus Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, wearing a long beaverskin coat, beaming at the sight of Harry's face and oblivious to the startled stares of passing Muggles. \"Harry!\" he boomed, sweeping Harry into a bone-crushing hug the moment Harry had stepped out of the car. \"Buckbeak - Witherwings, I mean - yeh should see him, Harry, he's so happy ter be back in the open air -\"\n\"Glad he's pleased,\" said Harry, grinning as he massaged his ribs. \"We didn't know 'security' meant you!\" \"I know, jus' like old times, innit?

Hagrid raised his pink umbrella and rapped a certain brick in the wall, which opened at once to form an archway onto a winding cobbled street. They stepped through the entrance and paused, looking around. Diagon Alley had changed. The colorful, glittering window displays of spellbooks, potion ingredients, and cauldrons were lost to view, hidden behind the large Ministry of Magic posters that had been pasted over them. Most of these somber purple posters carried blown-up versions of the security advice on the Ministry pamphlets that had been sent out over the summer, but others bore moving black-and-white photographs of Death Eaters known to be on the loose."}

Mrs. Weasley did not look entirely convinced, but allowed the separation, scurrying off toward Flourish and Blotts with her husband and Ginny while Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Hagrid set off for Madam Malkin's. Harry noticed that many of the people who passed them had the same harried, anxious look as Mrs. Weasley, and that nobody was stopping to talk anymore; the shoppers stayed together in their own tightly knit groups, moving intently about their business."}

I am perfectly capable of doing my shopping alone.\" There was a clucking noise and a voice Harry recognized as that of Madam Malkin, the owner, said, \"Now, dear, your mother's quite right, none of us is supposed to go wandering around on our own anymore, it's nothing to do with being a child -\"\n\"Watch where you're sticking that pin, will you!\" A teenage boy with a pale, pointed face and white-blond hair appeared from behind the rack, wearing a handsome set of dark green robes that glittered with pins around the hem and the edges of the sleeves.

Hermione, who was standing slightly behind them, whispered, \"No, don't, honestly, it's not worth it. ...\"\n\"Yeah, like you'd dare do magic out of school,\" sneered Malfoy. \"Who blacked your eye, Granger?

She was distracted all through the fitting of Ron's and Harry's new robes, tried to sell Hermione wizard's dress robes instead of witch's, and when she finally bowed them out of the shop it was with an air of being glad to see the back of them. \"Got ev'rything?\""}

Mr. Weasley was delightedly examining a pack of Muggle marked playing cards. Fred and George were both helping customers. On the other side of the glass, Hagrid was standing with his back to them, looking up and down the street. \"Get under here, quick,\" said Harry, pulling his Invisibility Cloak out of his bag. \"Oh - I don't know, Harry,\" said Hermione, looking uncertainly toward Mrs. Weasley. \"Come on!\" said Ron. She hesitated for a second longer, then ducked under the cloak with Harry and Ron. Nobody noticed them vanish; they were all too interested in Fred and George's products. Harry, Ron, and Hermione squeezed their way out of the door as quickly as they could, but by the time they gained the street, Malfoy had disappeared just as successfully as they had."}

Judging by the movements of Malfoy's hands, he was talking animatedly. The proprietor of the shop, Mr. Borgin, an oily-haired, stooping man, stood facing Malfoy.

Next moment, the bell over the door tinkled loudly as Malfoy stalked out of the shop looking very pleased with himself.

He could see Mrs. Weasley and the grim-faced Auror casting the pair of them suspicious looks as they moved away. \"When we were in Diagon Alley,\" Harry began, but Mr. Weasley forestalled him with a grimace. \"Am I about to discover where you, Ron, and Hermione disappeared to while you were supposed to be in the back room of Fred and George's shop?\" \"How did you - ?\" \"Harry, please.

Harry,\nI would be delighted if you would join me for a bite of lunch in compartment C.\nSincerely,\nProfessor H. E. F.

Harry stowed it regretfully back in his bag, reflecting that it would have been nice to wear it just to avoid all the staring, which seemed to have increased in intensity even since he had last walked down the train. Every now and then, students would hurtle out of their compartments to get a better look at him. The exception was Cho Chang, who darted into her compartment when she saw Harry coming. As Harry passed the window, he saw her deep in determined conversation with her friend Marietta, who was wearing a very thick layer of makeup that did not entirely obscure the odd formation of pimples still etched across her face. Smirking slightly, Harry pushed on. When they reached compartment C, they saw at once that they were not Slughorn's only invitees, although judging by the enthusiasm of Slughorn's welcome, Harry was the most warmly anticipated. \"Harry, m'boy!\" said Slughorn, jumping up at the sight of him so that his great velvet-covered belly seemed to fill all the remaining space in the compartment. His shiny bald head and great silvery mustache gleamed as brightly in the sunlight as the golden buttons on his waistcoat. \"Good to see you, good to see you!

Do you see much of your uncle, Marcus?\" Unfortunately, Belby had just taken a large mouthful of pheasant; in his haste to answer Slughorn he swallowed too fast, turned purple, and began to choke. \"Anapneo,\" said Slughorn calmly, pointing his wand at Belby, whose airway seemed to clear at once. \"Not ... not much of him, no,\" gasped Belby, his eyes streaming."}

Everyone here seemed to have been invited because they were connected to somebody well-known or influential - everyone except Ginny. Zabini, who was interrogated after McLaggen, turned out to have a famously beautiful witch for a mother (from what Harry could make out, she had been married seven times, each of her husbands dying mysteriously and leaving her mounds of gold).

Harry seized the door and pushed it open, hard; Zabini, still clinging on to the handle, toppled over sideways into Gregory Goyle's lap, and in the ensuing ruckus, Harry darted into the compartment, leapt onto Zabini's temporarily empty seat, and hoisted himself up into the luggage rack. It was fortunate that Goyle and Zabini were snarling at each other, drawing all eyes onto them, for Harry was quite sure his feet and ankles had been revealed as the cloak had flapped around them; indeed, for one horrible moment he thought he saw Malfoy's eyes follow his trainer as it whipped upward out of sight. But then Goyle slammed the door shut and flung Zabini off him; Zabini collapsed into his own seat looking ruffled, Vincent Crabbe returned to his comic, and Malfoy, sniggering, lay back down across two seats with his head in Pansy Parkinson's lap. Harry lay curled uncomfortably under the cloak to ensure that every inch of him remained hidden, and watched Pansy stroke the sleek blond hair off Malfoy's forehead, smirking as she did so, as though anyone would have loved to have been in her place. The lanterns swinging from the carriage ceiling cast a bright light over the scene: Harry could read every word of Crabbe's comic directly below him. \"So, Zabini,\" said Malfoy, \"what did Slughorn want?\" \"Just trying to make up to well-connected people,\" said Zabini, who was still glowering at Goyle. \"Not that he managed to find many.\" This information did not seem to please Malfoy."}

Harry looked sideways at Tonks under his cloak. Last year she had been inquisitive (to the point of being a little annoying at times), she had laughed easily, she had made jokes. Now she seemed older and much more serious and purposeful. Was this all the effect of what had happened at the Ministry?"}

He was far from blaming her for Sirius's death; it was no more her fault than anyone else's (and much less than his), but he did not like talking about Sirius if he could avoid it. And so they tramped on through the cold night in silence, Tonks's long cloak whispering on the ground behind them. Having always traveled there by carriage, Harry had never before appreciated just how far Hogwarts was from Hogsmeade Station. With great relief he finally saw the tall pillars on either side of the gates, each topped with a winged boar. He was cold, he was hungry, and he was quite keen to leave this new, gloomy Tonks behind. But when he put out a hand to push open the gates, he found them chained shut."}

Security's been tightened a hundredfold this summer.\" \"Well then,\" said Harry, starting to feel annoyed at her lack of helpfulness, \"I suppose I'll just have to sleep out here and wait for morning.\" \"Someone's coming down for you,\" said Tonks. \"Look.\""}

Harry was so pleased to see it he felt he could even endure Filch's wheezy criticisms of his tardiness and rants about how his timekeeping would improve with the regular application of thumbscrews. It was not until the glowing yellow light was ten feet away from them, and Harry had pulled off his Invisibility Cloak so that he could be seen, that he recognized, with a rush of pure loathing, the uplit hooked nose and long, black, greasy hair of Severus Snape. \"Well, well, well,\" sneered Snape, taking out his wand and tapping the padlock once, so that the chains snaked backward and the gates creaked open. \"Nice of you to turn up, Potter, although you have evidently decided that the wearing of school robes would detract from your appearance.\""}

And incidentally,\" said Snape, standing back to allow Harry to pass him, \"I was interested to see your new Patronus.\" He shut the gates in her face with a loud clang and tapped the chains with his wand again, so that they slithered, clinking, back into place. \"I think you were better off with the old one,\" said Snape, the malice in his voice unmistakable."}

He had loathed Snape from their first encounter, but Snape had placed himself forever and irrevocably beyond the possibility of Harry's forgiveness by his attitude toward Sirius. Whatever Dumbledore said, Harry had had time to think over the summer, and had concluded that Snape's snide remarks to Sirius about remaining safely hidden while the rest of the Order of the Phoenix were off fighting Voldemort had probably been a powerful factor in Sirius rushing off to the Ministry the night that he had died. Harry clung to this notion, because it enabled him to blame Snape, which felt satisfying, and also because he knew that if anyone was not sorry that Sirius was dead, it was the man now striding next to him in the darkness. \"Fifty points from Gryffindor for lateness, I think,\" said Snape. \"And, let me see, another twenty for your Muggle attire. You know, I don't believe any House has ever been in negative figures this early in the term: We haven't even started pudding. You might have set a record, Potter.\" The fury and hatred bubbling inside Harry seemed to blaze white-hot, but he would rather have been immobilized all the way back to London than tell Snape why he was late."}

He knew that Snape had come to fetch him for this, for the few minutes when he could needle and torment Harry without anyone else listening. They reached the castle steps at last and as the great oaken front doors swung open into the vast flagged entrance hall, a burst of talk and laughter and of tinkling plates and glasses greeted them through the doors standing open into the Great Hall. Harry wondered whether he could slip his Invisibility Cloak back on, thereby gaining his seat at the long Gryffindor table (which, inconveniently, was the farthest from the entrance hall) without being noticed. As though he had read Harry's mind, however, Snape said, \"No cloak."}

The Great Hall, with its four long House tables and its staff table set at the top of the room, was decorated as usual with floating candles that made the plates below glitter and glow. It was all a shimmering blur to Harry, however, who walked so fast that he was passing the Hufflepuff table before people really started to stare, and by the time they were standing up to get a good look at him, he had spotted Ron and Hermione, sped along the benches toward them, and forced his way in between them. \"Where've you - blimey, what've you done to your face?\" said Ron, goggling at him along with everyone else in the vicinity. \"Why, what's wrong with it?\" said Harry, grabbing a spoon and squinting at his distorted reflection."}

He was very conscious that Ginny, Neville, Dean, and Seamus were listening in; even Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost, had come floating along the bench to eavesdrop. \"But -\" said Hermione. \"Not now, Hermione,\" said Harry, in a darkly significant voice. He hoped very much that they would all assume he had been involved in something heroic, preferably involving a couple of Death Eaters and a dementor. Of course, Malfoy would spread the story as far and wide as he could, but there was always a chance it wouldn't reach too many Gryffindor ears."}

Hagrid had never quite managed to comport himself with the dignity of Professor McGonagall, Head of Gryffindor House, the top of whose head came up to somewhere between Hagrid's elbow and shoulder as they were sitting side by side, and who was looking disapprovingly at this enthusiastic greeting. Harry was surprised to see the Divination teacher, Professor Trelawney, sitting on Hagrid's other side; she rarely left her tower room, and he had never seen her at the start-of-term feast before. She looked as odd as ever, glittering with beads and trailing shawls, her eyes magnified to enormous size by her spectacles. Having always considered her a bit of a fraud, Harry had been shocked to discover at the end of the previous term that it had been she who had made the prediction that caused Lord Voldemort to kill Harry's parents and attack Harry himself. The knowledge had made him even less eager to find himself in her company, but thankfully, this year he would be dropping Divination. Her great beaconlike eyes swiveled in his direction; he hastily looked away toward the Slytherin table. Draco Malfoy was miming the shattering of a nose to raucous laughter and applause. Harry dropped his gaze to his treacle tart, his insides burning again. What he would not give to fight Malfoy one-on-one ...\n\"So what did Professor Slughorn want?\" Hermione asked. \"To know what really happened at the Ministry,\" said Harry. \"Him and everyone else here,\" sniffed Hermione. \"People were interrogating us about it on the train, weren't they, Ron?\""}

I have assured the spirit community that I will not pester you for information, however. 'Harry Potter knows that he can confide in me with complete confidence,' I told them. 'I would rather die than betray his trust.' \"\n\"That's not saying much, seeing as you're already dead,\" Ron observed. \"Once again, you show all the sensitivity of a blunt axe,\" said Nearly Headless Nick in affronted tones, and he rose into the air and glided back toward the far end of the Gryffindor table just as Dumbledore got to his feet at the staff table.

Snape, who was sitting on Dumbledore's right, did not stand up at the mention of his name; he merely raised a hand in lazy acknowledgment of the applause from the Slytherin table, yet Harry was sure he could detect a look of triumph on the features he loathed so much. \"Well, there's one good thing,\" he said savagely. \"Snape'll be gone by the end of the year.\" \"What do you mean?\" asked Ron. \"That job's jinxed.

You are fighting that which is unfixed, mutating, indestructible.\" Harry stared at Snape. It was surely one thing to respect the Dark Arts as a dangerous enemy, another to speak of them, as Snape was doing, with a loving caress in his voice? \"Your defenses,\" said Snape, a little louder, \"must therefore be as flexible and inventive as the arts you seek to undo.

None of them had ever cast the charm without speaking, however. A reasonable amount of cheating ensued; many people were merely whispering the incantation instead of saying it aloud. Typically, ten minutes into the lesson Hermione managed to repel Neville's muttered Jelly-Legs Jinx without uttering a single word, a feat that would surely have earned her twenty points for Gryffindor from any reasonable teacher, thought Harry bitterly, but which Snape ignored."}

Harry bent low to retrieve the book, and as he did so, he saw something scribbled along the bottom of the back cover in the same small, cramped handwriting as the instructions that had won him his bottle of Felix Felicis, now safely hidden inside a pair of socks in his trunk upstairs.

Neither Ron nor Hermione was delighted by this. Although Harry had offered to share his book with both of them, Ron had more difficulty deciphering the handwriting than Harry did, and could not keep asking Harry to read aloud or it might look suspicious. Hermione, meanwhile, was resolutely plowing on with what she called the \"official\" instructions, but becoming increasingly bad-tempered as they yielded poorer results than the Prince's. Harry wondered vaguely who the Half-Blood Prince had been. Although the amount of homework they had been given prevented him from reading the whole of his copy of Advanced Potion-Making, he had skimmed through it sufficiently to see that there was barely a page on which the Prince had not made additional notes, not all of them concerned with potion-making. Here and there were directions for what looked like spells that the Prince had made up himself. \"Or herself,\" said Hermione irritably, overhearing Harry pointing some of these out to Ron in the common room on Saturday evening."}

Harry looked at his watch and hurriedly put the old copy of Advanced Potion-Making back into his bag. \"It's five to eight, I'd better go, I'll be late for Dumbledore.\" \"Ooooh!\" gasped Hermione, looking up at once."}

Harry proceeded through deserted corridors, though he had to step hastily behind a statue when Professor Trelawney appeared around a corner, muttering to herself as she shuffled a pack of dirty-looking playing cards, reading them as she walked. \"Two of spades: conflict,\" she murmured, as she passed the place where Harry crouched, hidden. \"Seven of spades: an ill omen. Ten of spades: violence. Knave of spades: a dark young man, possibly troubled, one who dislikes the questioner -\"\nShe stopped dead, right on the other side of Harry's statue. \"Well, that can't be right,\" she said, annoyed, and Harry heard her reshuffling vigorously as she set off again, leaving nothing but a whiff of cooking sherry behind her. Harry waited until he was quite sure she had gone, then hurried off again until he reached the spot in the seventh-floor corridor where a single gargoyle stood against the wall. \"Acid Pops,\" said Harry, and the gargoyle leapt aside; the wall behind it slid apart, and a moving spiral stone staircase was revealed, onto which Harry stepped, so that he was carried in smooth circles up to the door with the brass knocker that led to Dumbledore's office.

The circular office looked just as it always did; the delicate silver instruments stood on spindle-legged tables, puffing smoke and whirring; portraits of previous headmasters and headmistresses dozed in their frames, and Dumbledore's magnificent phoenix, Fawkes, stood on his perch behind the door, watching Harry with bright interest. It did not even look as though Dumbledore had cleared a space for dueling practice. \"So, Harry,\" said Dumbledore, in a businesslike voice. \"You have been wondering, I am sure, what I have planned for you during these - for want of a better word - lessons?\" \"Yes, sir.\""}

He felt his feet leave the office floor; he was falling, falling through whirling darkness and then, quite suddenly, he was blinking in dazzling sunlight. Before his eyes had adjusted, Dumbledore landed beside him. They were standing in a country lane bordered by high, tangled hedgerows, beneath a summer sky as bright and blue as a forget-me-not. Some ten feet in front of them stood a short, plump man wearing enormously thick glasses that reduced his eyes to molelike specks. He was reading a wooden signpost that was sticking out of the brambles on the left-hand side of the road. Harry knew this must be Ogden; he was the only person in sight, and he was also wearing the strange assortment of clothes so often chosen by inexperienced wizards trying to look like Muggles: in this case, a frock coat and spats over a striped one-piece bathing costume. Before Harry had time to do more than register his bizarre appearance, however, Ogden had set off at a brisk walk down the lane. Dumbledore and Harry followed. As they passed the wooden sign, Harry looked up at its two arms. The one pointing back the way they had come read: GREAT HANGLETON, 5 MILES. The arm pointing after Ogden said LITTLE HANGLETON, 1 MILE."}

Then the lane curved to the left and fell away, sloping steeply down a hillside, so that they had a sudden, unexpected view of a whole valley laid out in front of them. Harry could see a village, undoubtedly Little Hangleton, nestled between two steep hills, its church and graveyard clearly visible. Across the valley, set on the opposite hillside, was a handsome manor house surrounded by a wide expanse of velvety green lawn. Ogden had broken into a reluctant trot due to the steep downward slope. Dumbledore lengthened his stride, and Harry hurried to keep up. He thought Little Hangleton must be their final destination and wondered, as he had done on the night they had found Slughorn, why they had to approach it from such a distance. He soon discovered that he was mistaken in thinking that they were going to the village, however."}

Dumbledore and Harry followed him onto a narrow dirt track bordered by higher and wilder hedgerows than those they had left behind. The path was crooked, rocky, and potholed, sloping downhill like the last one, and it seemed to be heading for a patch of dark trees a little below them. Sure enough, the track soon opened up at the copse, and Dumbledore and Harry came to a halt behind Ogden, who had stopped and drawn his wand. Despite the cloudless sky, the old trees ahead cast deep, dark, cool shadows, and it was a few seconds before Harry's eyes discerned the building half-hidden amongst the tangle of trunks. It seemed to him a very strange location to choose for a house, or else an odd decision to leave the trees growing nearby, blocking all light and the view of the valley below. He wondered whether it was inhabited; its walls were mossy and so many tiles had fallen off the roof that the rafters were visible in places. Nettles grew all around it, their tips reaching the windows, which were tiny and thick with grime. Just as he had concluded that nobody could possibly live there, however, one of the windows was thrown open with a clatter, and a thin trickle of steam or smoke issued from it, as though somebody was cooking. Ogden moved forward quietly and, it seemed to Harry, rather cautiously. As the dark shadows of the trees slid over him, he stopped again, staring at the front door, to which somebody had nailed a dead snake. Then there was a rustle and a crack, and a man in rags dropped from the nearest tree, landing on his feet right in front of Ogden, who leapt backward so fast he stood on the tails of his frock coat and stumbled. \"You're not welcome.\" The man standing before them had thick hair so matted with dirt it could have been any color. Several of his teeth were missing. His eyes were small and dark and stared in opposite directions."}

The man in rags was now advancing on Ogden, knife in one hand, wand in the other. \"Now, look -\" Ogden began, but too late: There was a bang, and Ogden was on the ground, clutching his nose, while a nasty yellowish goo squirted from between his fingers. \"Morfin!\" said a loud voice. An elderly man had come hurrying out of the cottage, banging the door behind him so that the dead snake swung pathetically. This man was shorter than the first, and oddly proportioned; his shoulders were very broad and his arms overlong, which, with his bright brown eyes, short scrubby hair, and wrinkled face, gave him the look of a powerful, aged monkey."}

Two doors led off the main room, which served as kitchen and living room combined.

There was a scuffling noise in the corner beside the open window, and Harry realized that there was somebody else in the room, a girl whose ragged gray dress was the exact color of the dirty stone wall behind her. She was standing beside a steaming pot on a grimy black stove, and was fiddling around with the shelf of squalid-looking pots and pans above it. Her hair was lank and dull and she had a plain, pale, rather heavy face. Her eyes, like her brother's, stared in opposite directions. She looked a little cleaner than the two men, but Harry thought he had never seen a more defeated-looking person. \"M'daughter, Merope,\" said Gaunt grudgingly, as Ogden looked inquiringly toward her."}

Morfin let out a mad cackle of laughter. Gaunt screamed, \"Mend it, you pointless lump, mend it!\" Merope stumbled across the room, but before she had time to raise her wand, Ogden had lifted his own and said firmly, \"Reparo.\" The pot mended itself instantly."}

With a roar of rage, Morfin leapt out of his chair and ran at Ogden, brandishing his bloody knife and firing hexes indiscriminately from his wand. Ogden ran for his life. Dumbledore indicated that they ought to follow and Harry obeyed, Merope's screams echoing in his ears. Ogden hurtled up the path and erupted onto the main lane, his arms over his head, where he collided with the glossy chestnut horse ridden by a very handsome, dark-haired young man. Both he and the pretty girl riding beside him on a gray horse roared with laughter at the sight of Ogden, who bounced off the horse's flank and set off again, his frock coat flying, covered from head to foot in dust, running pell-mell up the lane. \"I think that will do, Harry,\" said Dumbledore.

Lack of sense coupled with a great liking for grandeur meant that the family gold was squandered several generations before Marvolo was born. He, as you saw, was left in squalor and poverty, with a very nasty temper, a fantastic amount of arrogance and pride, and a couple of family heirlooms that he treasured just as much as his son, and rather more than his daughter.\" \"So Merope,\" said Harry, leaning forward in his chair and staring at Dumbledore, \"so Merope was ... Sir, does that mean she was ... Voldemort's mother?\" \"It does,\" said Dumbledore. \"And it so happens that we also had a glimpse of Voldemort's father. I wonder whether you noticed?\" \"The Muggle Morfin attacked? The man on the horse?\" \"Very good indeed,\" said Dumbledore, beaming. \"Yes, that was Tom Riddle senior, the handsome Muggle who used to go riding past the Gaunt cottage and for whom Merope Gaunt cherished a secret, burning passion.\" \"And they ended up married?\" Harry said in disbelief, unable to imagine two people less likely to fall in love. \"I think you are forgetting,\" said Dumbledore, \"that Merope was a witch.

In any case, within a few months of the scene we have just witnessed, the village of Little Hangleton enjoyed a tremendous scandal. You can imagine the gossip it caused when the squire's son ran off with the tramp's daughter, Merope. \"But the villagers' shock was nothing to Marvolo's. He returned from Azkaban, expecting to find his daughter dutifully awaiting his return with a hot meal ready on his table. Instead, he found a clear inch of dust and her note of farewell, explaining what she had done. \"From all that I have been able to discover, he never mentioned her name or existence from that time forth. The shock of her desertion may have contributed to his early death - or perhaps he had simply never learned to feed himself.

What he meant, I am sure, is that he had been under an enchantment that had now lifted, though I daresay he did not dare use those precise words for fear of being thought insane.

Harry barely understood half of what Professor McGonagall said to them these days; even Hermione had had to ask her to repeat instructions once or twice. Incredibly, and to Hermione's increasing resentment, Harry's best subject had suddenly become Potions, thanks to the Half-Blood Prince. Nonverbal spells were now expected, not only in Defense Against the Dark Arts, but in Charms and Transfiguration too.

This was a good decision: The first ten was made up of first years and it could not have been plainer that they had hardly ever flown before. Only one boy managed to remain airborne for more than a few seconds, and he was so surprised he promptly crashed into one of the goal posts.

Pleased though he was with his choices, Harry had also shouted himself hoarse at the many complainers and was now enduring a similar battle with the rejected Beaters. \"That's my final decision and if you don't get out of the way for the Keepers I'll hex you,\" he bellowed. Neither of his chosen Beaters had the old brilliance of Fred and George, but he was still reasonably pleased with them: Jimmy Peakes, a short but broad-chested third-year boy who had managed to raise a lump the size of an egg on the back of Harry's head with a ferociously hit Bludger, and Ritchie Coote, who looked weedy but aimed well.

Harry caught sight of the headmaster only twice over the next few weeks. He rarely appeared at meals anymore, and Harry was sure Hermione was right in thinking that he was leaving the school for days at a time. Had Dumbledore forgotten the lessons he was supposed to be giving Harry? Dumbledore had said that the lessons were leading to something to do with the prophecy; Harry had felt bolstered, comforted, and now he felt slightly abandoned. Halfway through October came their first trip of the term to Hogsmeade. Harry had wondered whether these trips would still be allowed, given the increasingly tight security measures around the school, but was pleased to know that they were going ahead; it was always good to get out of the castle grounds for a few hours. Harry woke early on the morning of the trip, which was proving stormy, and whiled away the time until breakfast by reading his copy of Advanced Potion-Making. He did not usually lie in bed reading his textbooks; that sort of behavior, as Ron rightly said, was indecent in anybody except Hermione, who was simply weird that way. Harry felt, however, that the Half-Blood Prince's copy of Advanced Potion-Making hardly qualified as a textbook. The more Harry pored over the book, the more he realized how much was in there, not only the handy hints and shortcuts on potions that were earning him such a glowing reputation with Slughorn, but also the imaginative little jinxes and hexes scribbled in the margins, which Harry was sure, judging by the crossings-out and revisions, that the Prince had invented himself. Harry had already attempted a few of the Prince's self-invented spells. There had been a hex that caused toenails to grow alarmingly fast (he had tried this on Crabbe in the corridor, with very entertaining results); a jinx that glued the tongue to the roof of the mouth (which he had twice used, to general applause, on an unsuspecting Argus Filch); and, perhaps most useful of all, Muffliato, a spell that filled the ears of anyone nearby with an unidentifiable buzzing, so that lengthy conversations could be held in class without being overheard. The only person who did not find these charms amusing was Hermione, who maintained a rigidly disapproving expression throughout and refused to talk at all if Harry had used the Muffliato spell on anyone in the vicinity. Sitting up in bed, Harry turned the book sideways so as to examine more closely the scribbled instructions for a spell that seemed to have caused the Prince some trouble. There were many crossings-out and alterations, but finally, crammed into a corner of the page, the scribble:\nLevicorpus (nvbl)\nWhile the wind and sleet pounded relentlessly on the windows, and Neville snored loudly, Harry stared at the letters in brackets. Nvbl ... that had to mean \"nonverbal.\" Harry rather doubted he would be able to bring off this particular spell; he was still having difficulty with nonverbal spells, something Snape had been quick to comment on in every D.A.D.A."}

The bitter wind was like knives on their faces after the sugary warmth of Honeydukes. The street was not very busy; nobody was lingering to chat, just hurrying toward their destinations. The exceptions were two men a little ahead of them, standing just outside the Three Broomsticks. One was very tall and thin; squinting through his rain-washed glasses Harry recognized the barman who worked in the other Hogsmeade pub, the Hog's Head. As Harry, Ron, and Hermione drew closer, the barman drew his cloak more tightly around his neck and walked away, leaving the shorter man to fumble with something in his arms. They were barely feet from him when Harry realized who the man was. \"Mundungus!\" The squat, bandy-legged man with long, straggly, ginger hair jumped and dropped an ancient suitcase, which burst open, releasing what looked like the entire contents of a junk shop window. \"Oh, 'ello, 'Arry,\" said Mundungus Fletcher, with a most unconvincing stab at airiness."}

Harry's thoughts strayed to Ginny as they trudged up the road to Hogwarts through the frozen slush.

It was a little while before Harry became aware that the voices of Katie Bell and her friend, which were being carried back to him on the wind, had become shriller and louder.

Of course, it is also possible that her unrequited love and the attendant despair sapped her of her powers; that can happen. In any case, as you are about to see, Merope refused to raise her wand even to save her own life.\" \"She wouldn't even stay alive for her son?\" Dumbledore raised his eyebrows. \"Could you possibly be feeling sorry for Lord Voldemort?\" \"No,\" said Harry quickly, \"but she had a choice, didn't she, not like my mother -\"\n\"Your mother had a choice too,\" said Dumbledore gently. \"Yes, Merope Riddle chose death in spite of a son who needed her, but do not judge her too harshly, Harry. She was greatly weakened by long suffering and she never had your mother's courage. And now, if you will stand ...\"\n\"Where are we going?\" Harry asked, as Dumbledore joined him at the front of the desk. \"This time,\" said Dumbledore, \"we are going to enter my memory."}

Seconds later, his feet hit firm ground; he opened his eyes and found that he and Dumbledore were standing in a bustling, old-fashioned London street. \"There I am,\" said Dumbledore brightly, pointing ahead of them to a tall figure crossing the road in front of a horse-drawn milk cart.

He mounted the few steps leading to the front door and knocked once. After a moment or two, the door was opened by a scruffy girl wearing an apron. \"Good afternoon. I have an appointment with a Mrs. Cole, who, I believe, is the matron here?\" \"Oh,\" said the bewildered-looking girl, taking in Dumbledore's eccentric appearance. \"Um ... just a mo' ... MRS. COLE!\" she bellowed over her shoulder. Harry heard a distant voice shouting something in response. The girl turned back to Dumbledore."}

Harry and the older Dumbledore followed. Before the front door had closed behind them, a skinny, harassed-looking woman came scurrying toward them. She had a sharp-featured face that appeared more anxious than unkind, and she was talking over her shoulder to another aproned helper as she walked toward Dumbledore. \"... and take the iodine upstairs to Martha, Billy Stubbs has been picking his scabs and Eric Whalley's oozing all over his sheets - chicken pox on top of everything else,\" she said to nobody in particular, and then her eyes fell upon Dumbledore and she stopped dead in her tracks, looking as astonished as if a giraffe had just crossed her threshold."}

Then her eyes fell upon a bottle of gin and two glasses that had certainly not been present a few seconds before. \"Er - may I offer you a glass of gin?\" she said in an extra-refined voice. \"Thank you very much,\" said Dumbledore, beaming. It soon became clear that Mrs. Cole was no novice when it came to gin drinking. Pouring both of them a generous measure, she drained her own glass in one gulp. Smacking her lips frankly, she smiled at Dumbledore for the first time, and he didn't hesitate to press his advantage. \"I was wondering whether you could tell me anything of Tom Riddle's history? I think he was born here in the orphanage?\" \"That's right,\" said Mrs. Cole, helping herself to more gin. \"I remember it clear as anything, because I'd just started here myself."}

We wondered whether she came from a circus - and she said the boy's surname was to be Riddle. And she died soon after that without another word. \"Well, we named him just as she'd said, it seemed so important to the poor girl, but no Tom nor Marvolo nor any kind of Riddle ever came looking for him, nor any family at all, so he stayed in the orphanage and he's been here ever since.\" Mrs. Cole helped herself, almost absentmindedly, to another healthy measure of gin.

All I know is he and Billy had argued the day before.

His face was transfigured: There was a wild happiness upon it, yet for some reason it did not make him better looking; on the contrary, his finely carved features seemed somehow rougher, his expression almost bestial. \"Are you a wizard too?\" \"Yes, I am.\""}

To his great surprise, however, Dumbledore drew his wand from an inside pocket of his suit jacket, pointed it at the shabby wardrobe in the corner, and gave the wand a casual flick. The wardrobe burst into flames. Riddle jumped to his feet; Harry could hardly blame him for howling in shock and rage; all his worldly possessions must be in there. But even as Riddle rounded on Dumbledore, the flames vanished, leaving the wardrobe completely undamaged. Riddle stared from the wardrobe to Dumbledore; then, his expression greedy, he pointed at the wand. \"Where can I get one of them?\" \"All in good time,\" said Dumbledore. \"I think there is something trying to get out of your wardrobe.\""}

Riddle took down the quaking box. He looked unnerved. \"Is there anything in that box that you ought not to have?\" asked Dumbledore. Riddle threw Dumbledore a long, clear, calculating look. \"Yes, I suppose so, sir,\" he said finally, in an expressionless voice. \"Open it,\" said Dumbledore."}

You are not the first, nor will you be the last, to allow your magic to run away with you. But you should know that Hogwarts can expel students, and the Ministry of Magic - yes, there is a Ministry - will punish lawbreakers still more severely. All new wizards must accept that, in entering our world, they abide by our laws.\" \"Yes, sir,\" said Riddle again. It was impossible to tell what he was thinking; his face remained quite blank as he put the little cache of stolen objects back into the cardboard box.
